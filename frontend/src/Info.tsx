              I am a software engineer based in London and the co-founder of{" "}
              <a href="https://moneyed.co.uk">Moneyed</a>, a financial planning
              app. I initially studied Physics at the University of Oxford,
              where I undertook my undergraduate studies before completing a
              DPhil in particle physics 2011. After a period of postdoctoral
              study at Queen Maryâ€™s University of London I switched to industry,
              securing roles as Head of Engineering at{" "}
              <a href="https://octopuswealth.com/">Octopus Wealth</a> and VP
              Engineering at <a href="https://smarkets.com/">Smarkets</a>.

            <p>
              At present I contribute to open source in Python on projects
              relating to web development, including most notably the HTTP
              stack. I also have experience managing large industry tech and
              write Python, Typescript and Terraform.
