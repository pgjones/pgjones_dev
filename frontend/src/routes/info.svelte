          I am a software engineer based in London and the CTO of{" "}
          <a href="https://brickvest.com">Brickvest</a>. I initially studied
          Physics at the University of Oxford, where I undertook my
          undergraduate studies before completing a DPhil in particle physics
          2011. After a period of postdoctoral study at Queen Maryâ€™s University
          of London I switched to industry, securing roles as Head of
          Engineering at{" "}
          <a href="https://octopuswealth.com/">Octopus Wealth</a>
          and VP Engineering at
          <a href="https://smarkets.com/">Smarkets</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          At present I contribute to open source in Python on projects relating
          to web development, including most notably the HTTP stack. I also have
          experience managing large industry tech and write Python, Typescript
          and Terraform.
